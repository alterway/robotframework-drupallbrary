As an end user
==============

Of course, you do not need to understand any work of Python to help improving
**robotframework-drupallibrary**. You just need to know how to write
|robotframework| test cases and test suites that leverage its keywords.

File tickets to the |tracker| to :

- report bugs (please provide a |robotframework| test suite that fires the bugs)
- ask for new keywords
- ask for keyword changes if you're not comfortable with the
- help preparing support of future Drupal versions

As a developer
==============

I'm an experienced Python developer but some kind of noob - at the moment - in
the development **for** |robotframework|. So...

- I'm not sure to have the best design in some fields of this package (modules
  layout).
- I'm stuck to find an easy way to mock the downstream Selenium engine in the
  unit tests.
- I didn't find (or search correctly) recommended patterns in the |rf-user-guide|.
  Any pointer is welcome.

If you want to improve this package too, consider forking this project,
install your fork adapting the :ref:`developer_installation` guide.

Of course, your pull request is welcome. Just take some time to file a ticket
that explains it.
