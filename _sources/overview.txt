.. warning::

   Before going deeper in this documentation, I assume yo have decent skills
   about ATDD testing with |robotframework|.

   If you're new in that topic, I suggest you take a couple of hours to
   understand what is |robotframework| and how to write and organize your
   ATDD test suites, what's a Keyword, what's a Library, test SetUp and
   TearDown and how to organize your test data with that tool.

What's this ?
=============

This package provides a new keywords library intended to help authors of
Drupal sites functional testing scenarios setting up the site and shortcut
looooong fixture scripts using the classical and "all purpose"
`robotframework-selenium2library <https://github.com/rtomac/robotframework-selenium2library>`_.
